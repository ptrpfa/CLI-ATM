### Financial Data Processing
The dataset has already been pre-processed at this stage. However, you can follow these instructions, if you want to re-process the data again:
1. Run `process.py` on a terminal, ensuring that all necessary requirements are installed.
    ```python3 process.py```
2. Run `adhoc_process.py` to further process the data on the database
    ```python3 adhoc_process.py```
